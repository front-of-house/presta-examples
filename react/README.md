# react

Bare bones example of Presta with React.

## Overview

Since we need to define a custom renderer in `presta.config.js`, we might as
well define our `pages` there too. This means you don't have to specify page
paths on the CLI.

### Development

```
npx presta watch
```

Or for convenience:

```
npm start
```

### Production

```
npx presta build
```

Or for convenience:

```
npm run build
```

And to serve:

```
npx serve
```

Or:

```
npm run serve
```
